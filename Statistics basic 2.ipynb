    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They help us understand how much the data points differ from each other and from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Here's how each measure is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Range**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The range provides a simple measure of the spread by showing the extent of the data. However, it only considers the two extreme values and does not account for the distribution of the other data points.\n",
    "- **Example**: If the heights in a dataset range from 172.5 cm to 180 cm, the range is \\(180 - 172.5 = 7.5\\) cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Variance**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variance measures the average of the squared differences from the mean. It quantifies the overall spread of the data by considering how far each data point is from the mean.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Variance is useful for understanding the overall dispersion in a dataset, but because it involves squaring the differences, it can be harder to interpret directly, especially in terms of the original units.\n",
    "- **Example**: For a dataset of heights, the variance will tell us how much the heights vary around the mean height, on average. A high variance indicates a wide spread of heights, while a low variance indicates that most heights are close to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Standard Deviation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each data point from the mean, in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The standard deviation is widely used because it is easier to interpret than varianceâ€”it gives a measure of spread in the same units as the data. It tells us how much the data points typically deviate from the mean.\n",
    "- **Example**: If the standard deviation of the heights in a dataset is 1.79 cm, this means that, on average, each height is about 1.79 cm away from the mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Understanding Spread in a Dataset**\n",
    "Consider two datasets of student exam scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset A**: [85, 86, 87, 88, 89]\n",
    "- **Dataset B**: [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets might have the same mean (e.g., 87), but their spreads are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**: \n",
    "  - Dataset A: \\(89 - 85 = 4\\)\n",
    "  - Dataset B: \\(100 - 60 = 40\\)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Dataset B has a much wider range, indicating greater variability in scores.\n",

    "- **Variance and Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "  - Dataset A: Low variance and standard deviation, as all scores are close to the mean.\n",
    "  - Dataset B: High variance and standard deviation, as scores are spread out over a wide range.\n",

    "The relationship between the measures of central tendency in a normal distribution is as follows:\n",

    "Mean: The mean of a normal distribution is located at the center of the distribution, and it is equal to the median and the mode.\n",

    "Median: The median of a normal distribution is also located at the center of the distribution, and it is equal to the mean and the mode.\n",

    "This equality between the mean, median, and mode in a normal distribution is a characteristic of its symmetry. The symmetrical shape of the normal distribution curve is bell-shaped, and half of the data lies on either side of the mean, resulting in the median being the same as the mean and mode."
