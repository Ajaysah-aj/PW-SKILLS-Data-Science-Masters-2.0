    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They help us understand how much the data points differ from each other and from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Here's how each measure is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Range**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The range provides a simple measure of the spread by showing the extent of the data. However, it only considers the two extreme values and does not account for the distribution of the other data points.\n",
    "- **Example**: If the heights in a dataset range from 172.5 cm to 180 cm, the range is \\(180 - 172.5 = 7.5\\) cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Variance**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variance measures the average of the squared differences from the mean. It quantifies the overall spread of the data by considering how far each data point is from the mean.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Variance is useful for understanding the overall dispersion in a dataset, but because it involves squaring the differences, it can be harder to interpret directly, especially in terms of the original units.\n",
    "- **Example**: For a dataset of heights, the variance will tell us how much the heights vary around the mean height, on average. A high variance indicates a wide spread of heights, while a low variance indicates that most heights are close to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Standard Deviation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each data point from the mean, in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The standard deviation is widely used because it is easier to interpret than variance—it gives a measure of spread in the same units as the data. It tells us how much the data points typically deviate from the mean.\n",
    "- **Example**: If the standard deviation of the heights in a dataset is 1.79 cm, this means that, on average, each height is about 1.79 cm away from the mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Understanding Spread in a Dataset**\n",
    "Consider two datasets of student exam scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset A**: [85, 86, 87, 88, 89]\n",
    "- **Dataset B**: [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets might have the same mean (e.g., 87), but their spreads are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**: \n",
    "  - Dataset A: \\(89 - 85 = 4\\)\n",
    "  - Dataset B: \\(100 - 60 = 40\\)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Dataset B has a much wider range, indicating greater variability in scores.\n",

    "  - Dataset A: Low variance and standard deviation, as all scores are close to the mean.\n",
    "  - Dataset B: High variance and standard deviation, as scores are spread out over a wide range.\n",
