    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
    "It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is known as information hiding. This is typically achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public in some programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "Abstraction is typically achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called a subclass or child class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or parent class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "Inheritance supports the concept of \"is-a\" relationships, where the child class is a specialized version of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.\n",
    "Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters)."

    "Instance Reference:\n",
    "\n",

    "When you call a method on an object, self refers to the object on which the method was called.\n",
    "Accessing Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "\n",

    "Required as First Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, self must be the first parameter of any method in the class. It is not a keyword, but a naming convention. However, you could use any other name instead of self, though it is highly discouraged.\n",
