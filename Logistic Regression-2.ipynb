    "The purpose of **Grid Search with Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV)** in machine learning is to systematically search for the best hyperparameters that optimize the performance of a model. Hyperparameters are the parameters that are set before the learning process begins and cannot be learned from the training data (e.g., the regularization strength in logistic regression or the number of neighbors in k-nearest neighbors). Finding the right combination of hyperparameters is crucial to improve model accuracy, avoid overfitting, and ensure generalization to new data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### How Grid Search CV Works\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Define a Parameter Grid**: \r\n",
    "   - The user specifies a grid of hyperparameters and the corresponding values to explore. For example, for a Support Vector Machine (SVM), you might specify a range of values for the regularization parameter `C` and the kernel type.\r\n",
    "   - Example:\r\n",
    "     ```python\r\n",
    "     param_grid = {\r\n",
    "         'C': [0.1, 1, 10],\r\n",
    "         'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']\r\n",
    "     }\r\n",
    "     ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Train Multiple Models**: \r\n",
    "   - For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, a model is trained and evaluated.\r\n",
    "   - If there are 3 values for `C` and 2 values for `kernel`, grid search will try all 6 combinations of the parameters.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**:\r\n",
    "   - **Cross-validation** is applied to each hyperparameter combination to assess the model's performance. Cross-validation divides the training data into `k` subsets (folds). The model is trained on `k-1` folds and tested on the remaining fold, rotating this process across all folds.\r\n",
    "   - The performance is averaged over all `k` folds to give a more reliable estimate of model accuracy for each hyperparameter combination.\r\n",
    "   - Example with `k=5` (5-fold cross-validation):\r\n",
    "     - For each combination of hyperparameters, train the model on 4 folds and test it on the 5th fold.\r\n",
    "     - Rotate the test fold and repeat this process 5 times, then average the performance scores.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and Select the Best Model**:\r\n",
    "   - Once all hyperparameter combinations are evaluated, Grid Search CV selects the combination that produces the best performance, usually based on an evaluation metric like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC.\r\n",
    "   - The best model is retrained on the entire training dataset using the optimal hyperparameters.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Final Model**:\r\n",
    "   - After identifying the best hyperparameters, the final model can be trained on the entire training dataset, and the performance is tested on unseen test data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Code Example (Using Scikit-Learn):\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\r\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Define the model\r\n",
    "model = SVC()\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Define the parameter grid\r\n",
    "param_grid = {\r\n",
    "    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],\r\n",
    "    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']\r\n",
    "}\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Set up Grid Search with Cross-Validation (e.g., 5-fold cross-validation)\r\n",
    "grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Fit the model on the training data\r\n",
    "grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Get the best parameters and model\r\n",
    "best_params = grid_search.best_params_\r\n",
    "best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "print(f\"Best Parameters: {best_params}\")\r\n",
    "print(f\"Best Model Score: {grid_search.best_score_}\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Benefits of Grid Search CV:\r\n",
    "- **Systematic Search**: It automates the search for the best hyperparameters by trying all possible combinations.\r\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: It uses cross-validation to ensure that the chosen hyperparameters generalize well across different subsets of the training data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\r\n",
    "- **Improved Model Performance**: By tuning hyperparameters, grid search helps in finding the model with the highest predictive accuracy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Limitations:\r\n",
    "- **Computational Cost**: Grid search can be computationally expensive, especially when the grid is large or the model is complex, as it evaluates all combinations of hyperparameters.\r\n",
    "- **Scalability**: For high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, grid search can become inefficient, making alternatives like **Random Search** or **Bayesian Optimization** more desirable in some cases.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, Grid Search CV is a powerful tool to optimize machine learning models by searching for the best hyperparameters and ensuring that the model generalizes well through cross-validation."

    "### Difference Between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Both **Grid Search CV** and **Randomized Search CV** are hyperparameter tuning techniques used to find the best combination of hyperparameters in machine learning models. However, they differ in how they explore the hyperparameter space.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Grid Search CV**\r\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Grid Search CV exhaustively tries **all possible combinations** of the specified hyperparameter values in a grid. Each combination is evaluated using cross-validation, and the best one is selected based on the evaluation metric.\r\n",
    "   - **Exploration**: It systematically covers the entire hyperparameter space based on the defined grid.\r\n",
    "   - **Pros**:\r\n",
    "     - Guarantees finding the best combination of hyperparameters within the specified grid.\r\n",
    "     - Useful when you have a small number of hyperparameters or specific values to test.\r\n",
    "   - **Cons**:\r\n",
    "     - **Computationally expensive**: As the number of hyperparameters and their possible values increases, the number of combinations grows exponentially. This makes it computationally heavy, especially for large datasets or complex models.\r\n",
    "     - **Inefficient**: In many cases, not all combinations are necessary, and Grid Search might test values that have little effect on the model's performance.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   **Example**:\r\n",
    "   For a model with two hyperparameters (`C` and `gamma`), each with 3 possible values, Grid Search will test all 9 combinations:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   param_grid = {\r\n",
    "       'C': [0.1, 1, 10],\r\n",
    "       'gamma': [0.01, 0.1, 1]\r\n",
    "   }\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "   This leads to 9 possible hyperparameter combinations.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Randomized Search CV**\r\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Randomized Search CV selects **a random combination** of hyperparameters from the specified distribution for a fixed number of iterations. Instead of trying every possible combination, it samples hyperparameter values randomly and evaluates them using cross-validation.\r\n",
    "   - **Exploration**: Randomized Search explores the hyperparameter space randomly, testing a **subset of combinations** rather than all.\r\n",
    "   - **Pros**:\r\n",
    "     - **More efficient**: It allows you to limit the number of iterations, making it faster and less computationally expensive than Grid Search.\r\n",
    "     - **Scalable**: Works well with high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, where testing all combinations (as in Grid Search) would be infeasible.\r\n",
    "     - **Good enough results**: Often finds near-optimal hyperparameter values without needing to test every possible combination.\r\n",
    "   - **Cons**:\r\n",
    "     - May miss the exact best combination of hyperparameters, since it does not systematically explore the entire grid.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   **Example**:\r\n",
    "   For the same model with two hyperparameters (`C` and `gamma`), Randomized Search would randomly sample combinations for a specified number of iterations (e.g., 5 iterations out of 9 possible combinations):\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   param_dist = {\r\n",

    "### What is Data Leakage?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Data leakage** occurs when information from outside the training dataset inadvertently influences the model during the training process, leading to artificially high performance. Essentially, the model is given access to data that it wouldn't normally have during real-world predictions, causing it to learn from patterns that won’t be available during actual deployment. This makes the model overly optimistic during training and validation, but when applied to new data, its performance drops drastically because it hasn’t truly learned from the underlying features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Why is Data Leakage a Problem?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Data leakage is problematic because it results in:\r\n",
    "1. **Overestimation of Model Performance**: The model may appear to perform exceptionally well during cross-validation or on the training set because it’s using information it shouldn’t have. However, this leads to **poor generalization** to new, unseen data.\r\n",
    "2. **Misleading Insights**: In practice, the model might seem well-tuned during the development phase, but once deployed in a real-world setting, it could fail to perform adequately, leading to incorrect decisions or predictions.\r\n",
    "3. **Waste of Resources**: It can cause wasted time and resources, as you may believe the model is accurate when it actually has learned from irrelevant or unintended data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Types of Data Leakage\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Target Leakage**: This occurs when information that would not be available at prediction time is included in the training data. For example, if features are directly correlated with the target variable in ways that would not be true during real-time predictions.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "2. **Train-Test Contamination**: This happens when data from the test set leaks into the training set, often through improper data splitting or when preprocessing (e.g., normalization) is done on the entire dataset before splitting it into training and testing sets.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Example of Data Leakage\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Example 1: Target Leakage\r\n",
    "Imagine you are building a model to predict whether a person will be approved for a loan. Your dataset includes the following features:\r\n",
    "- Applicant's income\r\n",
    "- Loan amount requested\r\n",
    "- Credit history score\r\n",
    "- **Loan approval status (binary, yes/no)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, suppose you accidentally include **loan approval status** as a feature during model training. This would result in data leakage, because the model is using the feature that directly represents the target variable it’s supposed to predict. During training, the model will \"learn\" from the loan approval status, resulting in near-perfect accuracy. However, in a real-world scenario, this information won’t be available at prediction time, and the model would perform poorly.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Example 2: Train-Test Contamination\r\n",
    "Suppose you’re working on a machine learning project to predict housing prices. You have a dataset of house prices along with features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and year of sale. If you normalize or scale the entire dataset (including both the training and test sets) before splitting it into training and test data, data from the test set will influence the scaling of the training set. This allows information from the test set to leak into the training process, potentially leading to overly optimistic performance metrics.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### How to Avoid Data Leakage\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Proper Data Splitting**:\r\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets **before** doing any data preprocessing (e.g., normalization or scaling).\r\n",
    "   - Ensure that the test set remains unseen during all stages of training and validation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Careful Feature Selection**:\r\n",
    "   - Avoid including features that are generated or influenced by the target variable. For example, avoid features that are directly correlated with the outcome that you are trying to predict (e.g., post-event data like loan approval status).\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "3. **Time-based Splitting** (for time-series data):\r\n",
    "   - If you are dealing with time-series data, ensure that training data comes from the past, and test/validation data comes from the future. This prevents future information from leaking into the model during training.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**:\r\n",
    "   - Ensure proper cross-validation techniques, where each fold’s test set is unseen by the model until testing. Avoid doing any data manipulation (e.g., scaling, encoding) using information from theto the training process. This prevents data leakage through scaling.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Conclusion\r\n",
    "Data leakage is a critical problem in machine learning that can mislead performance metrics and lead to models that fail in real-world applications. To prevent leakage, always carefully manage feature selection, data preprocessing, and train-test splitting to ensure that no information from the test or future data influences the training process."

    "Preventing **data leakage** is crucial to ensure the reliability and generalizability of your machine learning model. Leakage occurs when information from the test data or from outside the model's intended inputs is improperly used during the training process. Below are key strategies to avoid data leakage:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Correct Train-Test Split**\r\n",
    "   - **Ensure test data is kept unseen**: The test data should be strictly separated from the training data before any form of preprocessing or feature engineering. You should not use any information from the test set when training the model.\r\n",
    "   - **Perform preprocessing after splitting the data**: Data preprocessing steps like scaling, encoding, or imputing missing values should only be applied **after** splitting the data into training and test sets. If preprocessing is done before splitting, it might introduce information from the test set into the training data.\r\n",
    "     - **Example**: \r\n",
    "       ```python\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       scaler = StandardScaler()\r\n",
    "       X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Fit on training data only\r\n",
    "       X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)        # Use the fitted scaler for test data\r\n",
    "       ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **Avoid Using Features That \"Leak\" Future Information**\r\n",
    "   - **Remove target-related features**: Ensure that no features are derived from, or influenced by, the target variable. Features that are created using future data or post-event information should be avoided in the training data.\r\n",
    "     - **Example**: If you are building a model to predict loan approval, you should not include variables like \"loan approval status\" or \"loan disbursal date\" as features, as these are known only after the prediction event.\r\n",
    "   - **Time-based splitting for time-series data**: In time-series models, data from the future should never be included when training the model on past data. Always ensure that data is split chronologically so that the model only uses information that would have been available at the time of prediction.\r\n",
    "     - **Example**: When predicting stock prices, do not use future stock prices as features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. **Use Pipeline for Preprocessing and Model Building**\r\n",
    "   - **Pipeline integration**: Use machine learning pipelines (like Scikit-Learn's `Pipeline`) to ensure that all preprocessing steps are performed separately for training and test sets, and that the test data remains unseen during the training process. Pipelines allow you to combine preprocessing steps (like scaling, encoding, feature selection) with model training in a structured way, preventing accidental leakage.\r\n",
    "     - **Example**:\r\n",
    "       ```python\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       pipeline = Pipeline([\r\n",
    "           ('scaler', StandardScaler()),  # Scaling only happens after train-test split\r\n",
    "           ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())\r\n",
    "       ])\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Preprocessing and training occur in one step\r\n",
    "       ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Cross-Validation Done Correctly**\r\n",
    "   - **Ensure preprocessing within each fold**: During cross-validation, preprocessing (e.g., scaling, feature selection) must be done **inside** each fold, not on the entire dataset before splitting into folds. This prevents information from the test fold leaking into the training folds.\r\n",
    "     - **Example with cross-validation**:\r\n",
    "       ```python\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       # Create a pipeline with scaling and model\r\n",
    "       model_pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "       # Cross-validation with 5 folds\r\n",
    "       cv = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\r\n",
    "       scores = cross_val_score(model_pipeline, X, y, cv=cv)  # Scales within each fold\r\n",
    "       ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. **Handle Target Leakage in Feature Engineering**\r\n",
    "   - **Avoid using future information**: Be careful when creating features that might inadvertently use future or outcome-related information. For example, in predicting customer churn, including features like \"whether the customer called support after cancellation\" would introduce target leakage because it uses information that would not be available at prediction time.\r\n",
    "   - **Check correlation with target**: If a feature is highly correlated with the target variable, ensure it is not leaking future information by reviewing its definition and timing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. **Use Correct Validation Strategy for Time-Series Data**\r\n",
    "   - **Time-based cross-validation**: In time-series forecasting, use techniques like **time-series cross-validation** (e.g., walk-forward validation) where the model is trained on past data and tested on future data in each fold, preventing future data from influencing the training process.\r\n",
    "     - **Example**:\r\n",
    "       ```python\r\n",
    "       from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\r\n",
    "       tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)\r\n",
    "       for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):\r\n",
    "           X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]\r\n",
    "           y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]\r\n",
    "       ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 7. **Monitor for Leakage in Domain-Specific Features**\r\n",
    "   - **Domain knowledge**: Use domain expertise to carefully assess the features in your dataset. Features that seem harmless can sometimes introduce leakage, especially in medical, financial, or temporal datasets where certain events may only be known after the prediction outcome.\r\n",
    "   - **Check for target leaks**: Ensure that no feature provides \"post-event\" data that wouldn’t be available at the time of prediction.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 8. **Regularly Audit and Validate the Data Pipeline**\r\n",
    "   - **Review preprocessing steps**: Regularly audit your data pipeline and preprocessing steps to ensure that information from test or validation sets isn’t leaking into the training process.\r\n",
    "   - **Validate assumptions**: Periodically test the pipeline with fresh data and evaluate performance consistency to confirm that there are no hidden leaks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Common Examples of Data Leakage and Prevention:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Scaling/Normalization**: Leakage occurs if you scale/normalize the entire dataset before splitting into train/test sets. **Prevention**: Scale only the training set and apply the same scaling parameters to the test set.\r\n",
    "- **Target-Related Features**: Leakage occurs if you include a feature generated after the event (e.g., transaction approval status). **Prevention**: Review features to ensure no future data is used.\r\n",
    "- **Train-Test Contamination**: Leakage occurs if test data is used during training or validation. **Prevention**: Split the dataset properly and ensure the test set remains untouched until the final evaluation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Conclusion:\r\n",
    "To prevent data leakage, it's essential to maintain strict separation of training, validation, and test data and to handle preprocessing and feature engineering with care. Use pipelines, appropriate cross-validation, and domain knowledge to avoid introducing future or target-related information into the training process. Preventing leakage ensures that your model’s performance is reliable and generalizes well to new, unseen data."

    "A confusion matrix can be a powerful tool to uncover potential biases or limitations in a machine learning model by revealing how the model performs across different classes and types of errors. Here’s how you can use it to identify these issues:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. **Class Imbalance**\r\n",
    "   - **Identify Imbalance**: By examining the number of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN) for each class, you can spot if the model is biased toward certain classes.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In a medical diagnosis task with classes \"Disease\" and \"No Disease,\" if the model predicts \"No Disease\" very frequently, it might be biased toward the majority class.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Check Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for each class. A class with low Precision and Recall indicates it may be underrepresented or not well-predicted.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\r\n",
    "   print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. **False Positive and False Negative Analysis**\r\n",
    "   - **Understand Error Types**: Analyze FP and FN to understand where the model is making errors. High FP might indicate that the model is over-predicting a class, while high FN might show under-prediction.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In a fraud detection system, a high number of False Negatives could mean that actual frauds are not being detected effectively.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Compute False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) to evaluate these errors.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\r\n",
    "   tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()\r\n",
    "   fpr = fp / (fp + tn)\r\n",
    "   fnr = fn / (fn + tp)\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. **Performance Across Different Classes**\r\n",
    "   - **Evaluate Class Performance**: Compare performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score) across different classes to identify if certain classes are consistently performing poorly.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In a multi-class classification problem, if one class has significantly lower metrics compared to others, it indicates a potential bias or limitation in handling that specific class.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Use metrics for each class individually and look for discrepancies.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\r\n",
    "   print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred, target_names=class_names))\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4. **Error Distribution Analysis**\r\n",
    "   - **Assess Error Patterns**: Examine how errors are distributed among different classes. A confusion matrix can show if certain classes are frequently misclassified as others.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In image classification, if “cat” is often misclassified as “dog,” this might suggest a need for better feature differentiation between these classes.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Check the off-diagonal elements in the confusion matrix to identify which classes are being confused with each other.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import seaborn as sns\r\n",
    "   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n",
    "   cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)\r\n",
    "   sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=class_names, yticklabels=class_names)\r\n",
    "   plt.show()\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5. **Bias Toward Majority Class**\r\n",
    "   - **Spot Majority Class Bias**: If the confusion matrix shows a high number of TN and low TP for a minority class, the model may be biased towards the majority class, neglecting the minority class.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Compare metrics like Recall for minority classes against majority classes to evaluate if there’s a significant disparity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 6. **Model Performance Across Different Subgroups**\r\n",
    "   - **Assess Subgroup Fairness**: If the model is used in a context with different subgroups (e.g., demographic groups), analyze performance metrics for each subgroup to check for biases.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In a credit scoring model, evaluate the confusion matrix separately for different demographic groups to ensure fair treatment across groups.\r\n",
    "   - **Metric**: Compare performance metrics across different subgroups to identify any significant performance disparities.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 7. **Adjust for Misclassification Costs**\r\n",
    "   - **Evaluate Cost Sensitivity**: If misclassifications have different costs (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives), use the confusion matrix to analyze the impact and adjust the model accordingly.\r\n",
    "   - **Example**: In medical diagnostics, the cost of a false negative might be higher than a false positive. Analyze the confusion matrix to assess if the model appropriately balances these costs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   # Example calculation of cost-sensitive metrics\r\n",
    "   cost_of_fp = 1\r\n",
    "   cost_of_fn = 10\r\n",
    "   total_cost = (fp * cost_of_fp) + (fn * cost_of_fn)\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using a confusion matrix to identify potential biases or limitations involves:\r\n",
    "- Examining class imbalances and their impact on performance metrics.\r\n",
    "- Analyzing error types and their distribution to understand model weaknesses.\r\n",
    "- Comparing performance metrics across different classes and subgrd make necessary adjustments to improve overall fairness and effectiveness."
